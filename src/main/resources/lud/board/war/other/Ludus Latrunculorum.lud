        (description "Ludus Latrunculorum (\"Game of Robbers\") is a game from the Roman Empire, beginning in the final centuries BCE, that appears to have been particularly popular in the Roman military. It is mentioned in various authors such as Ovid, Seneca, and Isidore of Seville. Boards have ben found throughout the areas occupied by the Romans, especially in forts. Boards range in size from 6x7 to 14x14 and are not always exactly square. Glass counters were frequently used as pieces. Some speculation exists that this game developed into later tafl games.")

                When all the pieces have been placed, the players take turns moving pieces on the board. The pieces can be moved orthogonally to any adjacent square. A piece can leap over any single piece of either color, if the square behind is unoccupied. Several leaps in one turn are possible (as in Draughts).
                If a player can trap an enemy piece between two friendly pieces, the enemy piece is blocked and cannot be moved. 
                On the next turn, instead of moving a piece, the player can capture the trapped piece by removing it from the board, provided his own two surrounding pieces are still free. The trapped piece is immediately free if one of its two enemies is itself surrounded.
                A player reduced to only one piece left on the board has lost the game.
