Pieces begin on one half of a player's side of the board (the half to the left of one player, and to the right of the other player), two per space, then two on the next space and one on the space following that one. Three six-sided dice. Players move according to the number on each die by moving one piece the value on one die then another piece the value on the other die, or by moving one piece the value of one die and then the value of the other. Pieces move in a track the long way around the board toward the portion where the opponent begins. No more than two pieces can occupy a space at a time. When a piece lands on a space occupied by a single piece of the opponent, the opponent's piece is removed from the board. Players attempt to bear off their pieces by rolling the exact number of spaces left on the board, plus one. The first player to bear off all their pieces wins.")
